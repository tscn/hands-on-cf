* CF CLI for your OS
* JDK 1.8 for your OS
* Any Java or text editor of your choice

## How to use it

Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/tscn/hands-on-cf`. 

Target your Cloudfoundry environment with `cf login -a api.sys.adpcloud.pcfenv.com -u userX -p userX`.

Change working directory to the cloned repository and run `cf push`. This command will run a few seconds and finally print an address. Copy this address and open it with a browser.
